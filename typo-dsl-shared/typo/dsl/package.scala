  /** This is a tuple, but it's possible to construct and deconstruct it without all the parentheses.
    *
    * The trick works because you can use infix notation for types in scala, so you can write `A ~ B` instead of `(A, B)`.
    *
    * The same can be with any binary type constructor, like `A Either B`.
    *
    * It's very rarely a good idea, but for representing joins in typo it was very liberating to get rid of the deeply nested tuples.
    *
    * {{{
    *   1 ~ 2 ~ 3 match {
    *     case a ~ b ~ c => println(a + b + c)
    *   }
    * }}}
    *
    * For scala 3 there are better ways to do this, but this is a simple way to do it which works in both intellij and scala 2
